 #Trajectory-Inference-Methods-applied-on-early-cell-lines-from-human-embryo: This repository is dedicated to furthering 
 understanding of Trajectory Inference(TI). Thus, you will find here TI methods applied toward single cells of early human 
 embryonic tissues(sc-RNA sequencing) as an example for the application of these methods. All are welcome to share thoughts or ideas 
 as this project continues to develop.
